# compareFiles README

This program has a series of functions meant to compare files, collect a list of users to permanently 
delete, overwrite and format files, and send messages to both users to be deleted and to the admin.

 The function compareFiles(), takes in two files as arguments and compare them to find if any users
 are found in both files.  If a user is in both files, it means they have not responded to our warning 
 messages that they need to log in to keep their account else email us to delete it.  It will add such 
 users to a new files called Users_to_Delete.txt. 
 -It encodes this list as into a json readable format.
 -each user is saved in the format of a dictionary with their email address and username:
  ex: {'emailAddress': '...@optum.com', 'username': '...'}
 
 The function collectUserToDelete() takes in a list of all of the users to permanently delete produced
 by the compareFiles() function and creates a new list with just their emails.
 
 The functions overWriteFile() and formatFile() are to overwrite the old file containing the list of users 
 to delete with the new file of list of users to delete. The formateFile() function is meant to format the 
 list of users to permanently delete such that it is human readable and will be emailed to the swiftkanban
 administrator
 
 The messageUsersToDelete() function sends a warning message to the users in the list of users to 
 permanently delete to inform them that they have not logged in or asked to have their account deleted during
 the month long grace period between when the program is scheduled to run.
 
 The sendFile() function is meant to send the list of all of the users to permanently delete formatted to be
 human readable to the administrator for swiftkanban for Optum.
