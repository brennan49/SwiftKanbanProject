SwiftKanban cleanup README

This program grabs information about all of the current users in the Functional Engineering organization
on SwiftKanban.
It first gets the user info of each user in the organization, puts them into a list, and then through
an API call, gets information such as each users last login date as well as their login information
(excluding password), etc.

It then compares the date three months ago from the current date to the last login date of the user.
If the user hasn't logged in for longer than three months they are added to a mailing list asking if they
would like to keep their account or not.

A group email, swift.users@optum.com has been created and will be used as the email to message if a user would
like their account deleted.  

An email will be sent to each user asking them to either login if they would like to keep their account else, they can 
send a response to the dummy email to have their account deleted. 

NOTE: in the getUsersToMessage() function, please provide a SwiftKanban username and password for the user that will be running 
this program.

This program is partnered with another called compareFiles.py.
