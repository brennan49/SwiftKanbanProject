How to use crontab to schedule the program:
*NOTE: you must be the root user of the server you will run the program on.
Crontab syntax:
[Minute] [Hour] [Day] [Month] [Weekday] program_being_used /location/to/the/program
you can use an asterisk (*) to match any value.  Such as using an asterisk for the month would cause
the command to run every month.
ex:  0 13 * 1-6 * python /usr/bin/example.py (runs /usr/bin/example at noon every day, for the first six months of the year)

-as root, type crontab -e
-type the command like about for how often you want the program to run
-to save your schedule hit :wq (exactly the same as using vim)

For this program it will be set up for the swift_cleanupv2.py program to run every friday at 10am
0 11 * * 5 python /usr/local/bin/swift_cleanupv2.py
compareFiles set up to run once a month on the 28th at 10:15am
